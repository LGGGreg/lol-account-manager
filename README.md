Save user names and passwords for multiple League of Legends accounts.

**LoL Account Manager LGG seamlessly integrates into your normal login screen, allowing you to save passwords and multiple users.**

This program is designed to seamlessly enhance the login window of League of Legends by allowing you to save your password, as well as multiple accounts.

This program is portable, no installation or un-installation needed, settings are saved in the folder you run it from.

This program uses encryption to protect your passwords, but being open source, it has a possibility of being cracked. Please try not to give people your settings file if you choose to save passwords. You are also free to decompile or view the source code to ensure that I don't take your passwords either.

Special Thanks to MiniDude22? for ideas on how to integrate it.
